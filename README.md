## About Ixian-S2

The Ixian S2 project aims to implement a decentralized, trustless data transmission and streaming network on top of the Ixian-DLT cryptocurrency. The goal of the S2 project is to provide a platform for the next generation of decentralized services which are easy to integrate into both existing and new projects, and provide options for fair monetization of services and content.

## Development branches

There are two main development branches:
* **master**: This branch is used to build the binaries for the official IXIAN DLT network. It should change slowly and be quite well-tested. This is also the default branch for anyone who wishes to build their Ixian software from source.
* **development**: This is the main development branch and the source for testnet binaries. The branch might not always be kept bug-free, if an extensive new feature is being worked on. If you are simply looking to build a current binary yourself, please use one of the release tags which will be associated with the master branch.

## Documentation

You can find documentation on how to build, APIs and other documents on [Ixian Documentation Pages](https://docs.ixian.io).
